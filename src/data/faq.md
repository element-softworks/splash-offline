        What are the Gundies?
        </h3>
        <p>
        The Gundie Awards are the firearms communities first and only award ceremony that spotlights top creators in the community. </p>
        <p>
        <h3>What makes the Gundies unique?</h3>
        <p>The Gundies is community driven, meaning you can vote for your favorite influencer, rather than the winners being picked by a panel of 
        judges. The control is in your hands.</p>
        <h3>Why should I care?</h3>
        <p>This is for fun. The Gundies is built on bringing the firearms community together. While influencers/creators with larger audiences are 
        more likely to win nominations, the Gundies is a place to find new people to follow that you may not know about! The Gundies is a community 
        effort to break through our community differences and have some fun… it is based off of “The Dundies” from the TV Show the office after all.</p>
